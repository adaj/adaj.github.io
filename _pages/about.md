Adelson started his PhD in the Department of Instructional Technology of the University of Twente (the Netherlands) in 2020, supervised by Ton de Jong, Susan McKenney, and Pantelis Papadopoulos.

In my PhD, I investigates how conversational agents can support dyads of students talking productively in online science labs. This involves several design challenges, because off-the-shelf chatbots solutions are not designed to handle group communication. My PhD is not centered in a technical contribution solely, but primarily, I am eager to help teachers and students improve their learning experience through productive peer communication.

My bachelor was in Computer Engineering, and M.Sc. in Systems & Computing, both at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil). During my bachelor and masters, I assisted the SmartMetropolis group and published my first conference papers. To support my project on predictive policing, I had the great opportunity to receive two research prizes from Google LARA (Latin America Research Awards, 2018 and 2019). I also worked as a data engineer in the Public Ministry of Rio Grande do Norte, managing a data lake infrastructure, supervising interns, and developing dashboards to help prosecutors analyze public budget-related issues.

My current research interests are conversational agents, computer-supported collaborative learning, language models, and ethics in AI.
