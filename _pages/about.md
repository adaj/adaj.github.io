Welcome! I am a PhD student at the Department of Learning, Data analytics and Technology (LDT) at University of Twente, where I am supervised by [Ton de Jong](https://users.gw.utwente.nl/jong/), [Susan McKenney](https://people.utwente.nl/susan.mckenney), and [Pantelis Papadopoulos](https://people.utwente.nl/p.m.papadopoulos).

In my PhD, I created and evaluated [Clair](https://clair.chat/), a conversational agent that foster productive student-student collaboration. 

I am broadly interested in investigating how data-driven applications can be designed to support the development of 21st-century skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. But also, I am an entushiast of the use of technology in the smart cities domain, including the development of predictive policing systems, and the use of AI in the public sector.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on a project. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
