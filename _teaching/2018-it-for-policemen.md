I gave a small workshop (around 5h along three sessions) for policemen
about what is Information Technology (IT), software, hardware, and peopleware.
The course was a requirement for the experienced policemen (+30 years of
service) to be promoted. The students were 50-60 years old. It was a nice
opportunity to train my teaching skills because I really had to be simple
and straightforward in the content explanation.
Also, nice to talk to policemen that work ethically (most of them) to make
good for society and have in Brazil such a low salary and unstable situation.
I also used the workshop to collect some data about what do they think
can influence most the spatial distribution of crime, e.g., geographic factors.
So I surveyed them to collect data and use in my masters thesis.
