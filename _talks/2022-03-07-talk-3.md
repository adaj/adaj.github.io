I presented in 20min my PhD proposal to an audience of 30 people, among
professors and students. The presentation was about how
conversational agents can make science students (~13 year old) can talk
online more productively. It was a nice opportunity to have questions about
the evaluation procedure that I will use.

The AID-E network is a nice venue for experts in
educational sciences to brainstorm about AI, some have programming experience so
the discussion groups are heterogeneous and the ideas very interesting. If you
plan to come and visit the network, please reach me by email.
